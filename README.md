Inside this repository is everything you need to reproduce my master thesis. There are several types of files contained here:

* .Rmd and .R, where the analysis happens 
* .RDS, where the input and output data are
* .html and .pdf, where the output is created

If you wish to explore these files you will need R and R Studio installed. You can find the correct version for your operating system at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. I used R version 4.1.2. You will also need to download several libraries, which can be found at the top of each .Rmd or .R file. See those for further details.
